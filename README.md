# React Native, Rum and `shadow-cljs`

I love `re-natal`, but there‘s a bit too much magic for my taste.
This presents a “magic-free” way to develop for React Native using
clojurescript, using [`rum`](`https://github.com/tonsky/rum`) for
interface building, and
[`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) to compile
the ClojureScript.
